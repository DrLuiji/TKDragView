## TKDragView

Universal draggable view.

Features:

- easy to use, flexible and universal solution if your user have to drag something:D
- built in manager
- by setting one property user can't use the same target frame twice 
- by setting another property only one drag view can be dragged at the same moment
- two animation speed modes : constant time and and constant velocity
- by setting one property drag view can be drag out of the current end frame or not


## Example Project

Example project is located in Demo directory. It provides some look how TKDragView can be used.


## Requirements

iOS 5.0

### ARC Support

TKDragView is compatible with Automatic Reference Counting, altough it's my first project with automatic memory management, so there might be some leaks.

##Todo

- Use UIViews instead of CGRects as a targets - will be easier to perform rotations, animations…

- Non-ARC branch (is there a need for that?)
